This code was built off of examples in class, and collaboration with Phillip Nguyen on some of the concepts, then refactored with input from Isabella Organ.

This is a simple node.js script that returns 'hello [name]', when you input 'greet' into the object 'greeter'.

In addition, from the project's home directory, type:
```
node index [name]
```
to return 'Hello [Name]'.

It includes gulp task runner, as well as mocha & chai testing.

to run the full suite of gulp tasks, type 'gulp task' this will lint the code, as well as run the tests via Mocha & Chai.
